Hi I'm Jacob. I am a stats grad student with an acturial prep minor from Cal Poly SLO. I built this site to share some of my favorite data projects, because I love to sit and work at a computer for hours on end :).

Obviously I love to visualize data in many ways and get the chance to test many peoples different hypotheses, but when im not buried in code, I do enjoy other things. I really enjoy to watch and consume anything sports related, right now I am watching a lot of basketball, soccer, football, and trying to learn baseball. If im not watching I'm usually playing, at least basketball or soccer. If you need a team to support follow me in my Manchester United fandom. Besides sports I also love to play some board games, never lost at Settlers of Catan, which is my claim to fame. Lately, I've really been trying to level up my cooking skills, open to any recommendations.
